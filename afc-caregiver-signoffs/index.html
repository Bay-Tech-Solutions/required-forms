          One of the Caregiver's responsibilities is the ongoing task of
          medication adherence for the Member. The Caregiver will need to fill
          out the Member's Medication Log for the RN Care Manager and the AFC
          Provider to review on a monthly basis. If the Member chooses to
          self-administer their medications, the Caregiver must document this in
          the Medication Log. The Caregiver is required to outline the reason
          for any missed medications in the Medication Log.
          <br /><br />
          I understand that the Caregiver must document all medications taken by
          the Member in a timely manner. If a Member misses a dose for any
          reason, the Caregiver must document the reason for the missed
          medication in the Medication Log. I further understand that the
          Caregiver must notify the RN Care Manager and the AFC Provider of any
          missed medications. The monthly Medication Log that is obtained at the
          end of every month.
